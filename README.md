# TeachersBreak
An android application for teachers to take small relaxation in their short breaks between their classes.I have saved a good playlist of relaxing music which will be played randomly in this page.This is made so that the teacher dont have to spend time and get tensed on selecting the music.For teachers to have a better experience, I have made the UI as much minimal as possible ( so scroll down and checkout the UI screen shots ).
This project way made for a hackathon conducted by MLH
